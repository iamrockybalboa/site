            <h2 class="title-sub">USER EXPERIENCE DESIGNER</h2>
          </div>


          <p>I was tasked with identifying usability gaps in workflows of a new systems management application. A goal of this
            project was to delight key customers by anticipating their needs. The best way to map customer workflows is to
            interview each customer directly and aggregate the results as a persona. I then presented this data as personas
            which can be easily referenced by any team member. As a result it quickly became clear to each member of the
            team which parts of the exiting applications provide real value to customers. </p>
          <p>Below you will find a summarized version of the processes and results.</p>

          <div class="title title--alt">
            <h3 class="title-secondary">Planning</h3>
          </div>

          <h2 class="title-sub margin-sub">RESEARCH</h2>

          <p>The success of the personas is directly determined by the accuracy of the data. By gathering info and forming relationships
            directly with customers guaranteed the best results.</p>

          <h2 class="title-sub margin-sub">Evangilization</h2>

          <p>The most critical step was to ensure each team member was familiar and comfortable with the personas. By making
            the personas easily consumable it made each team member well informed.</p>

            <h3 class="title-secondary">Sharing Personas with Product Teams</h3>
          </div>
          <p>After the personas were documented it became important for the product teams to share and adopt the new personas.
            The best way to do that was to use the development team wiki.</p>

            <h3 class="title-secondary">Building a Company Profile</h3>
          </div>
          <p>It was critical to understand not only who was managing the systems but what their infrastructure looked like. I built a company profile in the same wiki where I built the personas. This helped everyone understand the context of the personas above.</p>
